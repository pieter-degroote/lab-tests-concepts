# UltimateKEYS - MSKLC (testing - conceptual)

UltimateKEYS for Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.4.

This is a slimmed-down version (without Compose Key), since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.

**_Note that this version does not compile with MSKLC, since the bullet (â€¢) on 'AltGr + Shift + Space' causes this strange malfunctioning._**
