# Romanian Programmers Keyboard for AutoHotkey v2/v1.1

Romanian Programmers keyboard layout in AHK (overlay scripts for US QWERTY).  
These scripts can also be used to learn about the different key remappings and assignments in AutoHotkey v2 and v1.1.

## Prerequisites

These AutoHotkey scripts are highly customizable. To work properly, the Windows main/base keyboard layout has to be set to US QWERTY or a variant&nbsp;:

**=&gt; AltGr assigned to the AutoHotkey script**

- US-International (KBDUSX)
- Hausa (Latin)
- Romanian (Programmers)
- English (India)
- Czech Programmers
- Polish (Programmers)
- Hawaiian
- Greek Latin
- Igbo
- Sesotho sa Leboa / Setswana
- Latvian QWERTY (on Windows 11)
- or any other variant that is fully based on US QWERTY

**=&gt; Right Alt assigned to the AutoHotkey script (secondary choice)**

- United States (US)
- Maori (NZ Aotearoa)

**_Note about the standard base US layout&nbsp;:_**

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.  
To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:  
Win 11&nbsp;: &nbsp;*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Typing -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Win 10&nbsp;: &nbsp;*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change.
