# UltimateKEYS - Swapped Accented Letters

This experimental version features a keyboard layout on which the letters with an acute and a grave accent have switched places.

## Bug(s) in MSKLC (and/or Windows)

During testing, I found a smaller bug with the MSKLC version, as the capital character 'Ã‰' did not work correctly (using AltGr + Shift + F, though it worked by enabling Caps Lock and then AltGr + F).  
I believe that this is a bug in MSKLC (and/or Windows) itself rather than in this UltimateKEYS port. Some testing with KbdEdit resulted in exactly the same problem.
