# UltimateKEYS Keyboard Layout - Core

**International US QWERTY layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys (Compose Key).**  
This layout is based on US QWERTY, and has borrowed some aspects from EurKEY and US-International.

This folder only contains the main keyboard layout of UltimateKEYS.

The additional Compose Key sequences (Multi_key) have not been included, since these change more frequently over time.

**Also note that the MSKLC version (for Windows) does not have the Compose Key, since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.**
