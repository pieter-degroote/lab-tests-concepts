# US QWERTY (for AutoHotkey v2/v1.1)

The following AutoHotkey scripts allow the user to type in US QWERTY, regardless of the keyboard layout which has been set on Windows.

**Note that I found several bugs and shortcomings during testing&nbsp;:**

For instance, it works great on Notepad, but when closing Notepad, it asks whether I want to "\[S\]ave", "Do\[n\]'t Save" or "Cancel". At that point, I cannot just hit the S or N button for either 'saving' or 'not saving' (as it should). It only works via 'Alt + S' or 'Alt + N', while holding down the Alt is just optional in this kind on dialog box.
