# Belgian AZERTY for AutoHotkey v2.0/v1.1

Belgian AZERTY layout in AHK (overlay scripts for US QWERTY).  
These scripts can also be used to learn about the different key remappings and assignments in AutoHotkey v2.0 and v1.1.

Prerequisites&nbsp;:

The base keyboard layout has to be configured as US QWERTY.

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.

To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:

*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*

Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change...
