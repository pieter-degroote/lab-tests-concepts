# EurKEY - AutoHotkey Scripts for v2/v1.1 (testing)

This folder contains the unofficial AHK scripts for EurKEY v1.1 to v1.3.  
The EurKEY scripts are simply targeted towards more 'conservative' users (meeting their basic needs).  
On the other hand, UltimateKEYS generally takes a more dynamic and advanced approach instead.

## Prerequisites

To work properly, the Windows main/base keyboard layout has to be set to either&nbsp;:

- **Hausa (Latin - Nigeria)** =&gt; AltGr assigned to EurKEY (best layout, based on US QWERTY).
- **United States (US)** =&gt; Right Alt assigned to EurKEY (second best layout).

*Note about the standard base US layout&nbsp;:*

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.  
To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:  
*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change.
