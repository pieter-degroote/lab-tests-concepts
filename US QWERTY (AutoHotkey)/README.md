# US QWERTY (for AutoHotkey v2/v1.1)

The following AutoHotkey scripts allow the user to type in US QWERTY, regardless of the keyboard layout which has been set on Windows.

**_Note that I found several bugs and shortcomings during testing&nbsp;:_**

For instance, it works great on Notepad, but when closing Notepad, it asks whether I want to "\[S\]ave", "Do\[n\]'t Save" or "Cancel". At that point, I cannot just hit the S or N key for either 'saving' or 'not saving' (as it should). It only works via 'Alt + S' or 'Alt + N', while holding down the Alt is just optional in this kind on dialog box.

## Important Notice - Security

**=&gt; Win/Linux&nbsp;: &nbsp;Only use "BASIC LATIN" characters (codes 32 to 126) for your Windows, Microsoft Live and Linux passwords&nbsp;!**  
Otherwise, it might be impossible to type any Unicode character higher than "Basic Latin" at the login screen/prompt (due to a different keyboard configuration)&nbsp;!&emsp;**=&gt;&emsp;ACCOUNT LOCKOUT**

**=&gt; Win/Linux&nbsp;: &nbsp;ALWAYS make your system passwords VISIBLE during modification&nbsp;!**
