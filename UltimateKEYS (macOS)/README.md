# UltimateKEYS - '.keylayout' format (macOS)

This folder contains a test version of a '.keylayout' file for macOS.

Please note that this work is still in its testing stage (install/integrate at your own risk!).

This is a slimmed-down version (without Compose Key), just like the MSKLC edition.

This '.keylayout' file has been created by Ukelele 3.5.7 and edited with a text editor afterwards to get the desired results.

Unfortunately, the 'Press and Hold' functionality is not active on this keyboard layout, since this requires an additional '.plist' file (integrated into the 'Press and Hold' application). That way, the popover (pop-up) with variants of specific letters does not work.

## Known Issues - Disclaimer&nbsp;:

**=&gt; _Be aware that installing a custom keyboard layout on macOS can make the given layout show up TWICE, due to a bug in macOS._**  
**=&gt; _Removing that layout will only remove one entry, leaving that other entry behind as 'debris' on the system._**

**=&gt; _Please note that this version has not been thoroughly tested yet, and might contain bugs, flaws, shortcomings..._**  
**=&gt; _Install (or integrate) this '.keylayout' file at your own caution and responsibility&nbsp;!_**
