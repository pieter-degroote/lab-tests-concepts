# US Intl AltGr dead keys - AutoHotkey v2/v1.1

## Prerequisites

These AutoHotkey scripts are highly customizable. To work properly, the Windows main/base keyboard layout has to be set to either&nbsp;:

- United States (US)
- US-International
- Hausa (Latin, Nigeria)
- Romanian (Programmers)
- English (India)
- Czech Programmers
- Polish (Programmers)
- Maori (NZ Aotearoa)
- Hawaiian
- Greek Latin
- Latvian QWERTY (on Windows 11)

**_Note about the standard base US layout&nbsp;:_**

When two or more languages/keyboards are installed on the system, the default 'Alt + Shift' sequence will interfere with the AHK scripts.  
To avoid this, you can disable the interfering key sequences at&nbsp;:  
*Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Language -&gt; Spelling, typing &amp; keyboard settings (on the right) -&gt; Advanced keyboard settings -&gt; Input language hot keys*  
Please note that on the standard US QWERTY, the sequence 'Left Alt + Shift' also gets mistakenly triggered by 'Right Alt + Shift', resulting in an unexpected keyboard layout change.
