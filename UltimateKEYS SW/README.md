# UltimateKEYS - SW Variant

This modification features the SW (or 'switched') variant of UltimateKEYS for AutoHotkey (Win), MSKLC (Win) and Linux.

This means that the symbols !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*, (, ) are directly accessible and the numbers via Shift.

Note that the MSKLC version is a slimmed-down version (without Compose Key), since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.
