# UltimateKEYS - '.keylayout' format (macOS)

This folder contains a preliminary test version of a '.keylayout' file for macOS.

Note that the '.txt' file extension has been appended, due to its initial testing stage (renaming and installing at your own risk!).

This is a slimmed-down version (without Compose key), just like the MSKLC edition.

This 'UltimateKEYS (macOS).keylayout[.txt]' file has been created by Ukelele 3.5.7 and edited with a text editor afterwards to get the desired testing results.

Unfortunately, the 'Press and Hold' functionality is not active on this keyboard layout, since this requires an additional '.plist' file (integrated into the 'Press and Hold' application). That way, the popover (pop-up) with variants of specific letters does not work.

**_Please note that this version has not been thoroughly tested yet, and might contain bugs, flaws, shortcomings..._**
