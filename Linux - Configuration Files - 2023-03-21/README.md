# Linux - Configuration Files

This is a set of files for customizing Linux.

`chromium-flags.conf` and `chrome-flags.conf`&nbsp;: &nbsp;Forces the dark mode in the Chromium Browser and Google Chrome.  
=&gt; Usual location&nbsp;: &nbsp;"~/.config/"  
=&gt; Note that as for now, most Linux distributions and Desktop Environments should already 'honor' the 'preferred color scheme', making this setting (mostly) redundant.
