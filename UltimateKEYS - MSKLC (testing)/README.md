# UltimateKEYS - MSKLC (testing - conceptual)

UltimateKEYS for Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.4.

This is a slimmed-down version (without Compose Key), since MSKLC does not support multiple keystrokes as a sequence for a dead key.

## Bugs in MSKLC

During testing, I found a smaller bug with the MSKLC version, as the capital character 'É' did not work correctly.  
I believe that this is a bug in MSKLC rather than in this UltimateKEYS port.

**_Note that this version does not compile with MSKLC, since the bullet (•) on 'AltGr + Shift + Space' causes this strange malfunctioning._**
