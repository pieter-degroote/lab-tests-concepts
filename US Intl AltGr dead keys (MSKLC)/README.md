# US Intl AltGr dead keys (MSKLC - Win)

**US-International keyboard layout with AltGr (Right Alt) dead keys.**  
This layout simply moves all dead keys to the AltGr layer, and eliminates some other minor annoyances (e.g., `ç/Ç` now on its logical C key).  
This MSKLC implementation is targeted towards more 'conservative' users (meeting their basic needs).  
Note that it only has minimal differences from 'US-International' to achieve the desired results.
