# US Intl AltGr dead keys (MSKLC - Win)

**US-International keyboard layout with AltGr dead keys.**  
This layout simply moves all dead keys to the AltGr (+ Shift) layer, and eliminates some other minor annoyances (e.g., `รง/ร` on its logical key).  
This MSKLC implementation is targeted towards more 'conservative' users (meeting their basic needs).  
Note that it only has minimal differences from 'US-International' to achieve the desired results.
